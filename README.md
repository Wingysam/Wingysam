# ðŸ‘‹ Hello! I'm Wingy!

Some of my open-source projects:

* [autopause](https://github.com/Wingysam/autopause) automates mining cryptocurrency with NiceHash while not gaming, but not mining while gaming. I learned about using obscure APIs to get the result I need.
* [Power Remote for OpenLP](https://github.com/Wingysam/openlp-power-remote) is an alternative web remote for OpenLP to streamline the presenter experience. I improved my knowledge of Svelte and TypeScript.

Userscripts:
* [Git Archive](https://gist.github.com/53459985cf9feb9b235c6c183b06546d) automatically mirrors any git repositories I view. I learned about Userscripts and better understood git while making this.
